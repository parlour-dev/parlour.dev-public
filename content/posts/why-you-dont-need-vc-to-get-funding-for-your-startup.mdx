# 1/ Create a token

Tokens are great assets for funding your own blockchain&#x20;
startup. You will be the one that decides the supply and sells the token to investors.¬†

One benefit of that is the fact that crypto investors&#x20;
will more likely invest in a token rather than stock. ‚§µÔ∏è

This is a huge advantage, because tokens are easier to sell and save you the legal hassle ‚öñÔ∏è.&#x20;

# 2/ Create an NFT collection

NFTs are tokens that are non-fungible. This&#x20;
means that each one is unique and they're not interchangeable. $1 is&#x20;
always equal to $1 or 1 Bitcoin is always 1 Bitcoin, but that's not the&#x20;
case with NFTs. ‚§µÔ∏è

You can think of NFTs just like you would&#x20;
think about art üñºÔ∏è. Mona Lisa is not in any way equal to The Starry&#x20;
Night and therefore they cannot be exchanges 1:1.

Today, NFTs are mostly used to grant holders great utility and additional value.&#x20;
Another great benefit of NFTs is building community. Almost every NFT&#x20;
project has some devoted believers that support the vision and want to&#x20;
be a part of it.

If that concept sounds good to you, then you should definitely check that out. Here's an article we wrote on it:&#x20;
