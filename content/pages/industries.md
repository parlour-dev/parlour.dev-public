      # How ECAT transformed eCommerce with NFTs


      Ecat, a leading company in the Polish eCommerce industry, decided to adopt
      blockchain and NFTs into their business model. Their marketplace - Aderlo,
      was a perfect place to test blockchain solutions. That’s how the Aderlo
      NFT app was born.


      Aderlo NFT lets users mint the products they bought on the marketplace.
      That way, clients can track the history behind each product. Users can
      also review each vendor through their wallets.


      Parlour also partnered with Ecat by creating Aderlo Cashback Coin. ACC
      lets Aderlo clients gain cashback that is tradeable on various exchanges.
      The price of the token is determined not only by traditional supply and
      demand mechanisms but also by the discounts and bonuses it offers. The
      higher the discounts, the higher price of the token.

      # A tokenized building in Dubai


      As everyone knows, the real estate market is growing faster and faster
      each year. While it is obvious that the land and the apartments themselves
      reach exorbitant prices, it is not so rare to see the right to preemption
      itself being sold for tens of thousands of dollars.


      For example, in Dubai, a common sight is seeing people lining up in
      multi-hour queues so that they can buy a right to preemption for their
      client. This creates a vacuum for a market on which those rights could be
      sold. Unfortunately, one could find enormous difficulty while creating
      such a market (regulations, no platform for such a product).


      Now imagine an NFT granting an individual the right to preemption. Such an
      individual could hold that NFT both as an investment and as a tool
      guaranteeing access to his dreamt-of apartment. The developer delivering
      the building could then easily create a community around the owners of
      those tokens.

      # Subscription model, but better


      More and more people are having their supplements delivered. Sometimes
      things don't work out, and the customers dislike the product. In that
      case, they can either refund the service (if possible) or never buy
      anything else from the supplements provider.&#x20;


      Now imagine such a subscription as a club membership. Members of such a
      club would be entitled to all benefits about which we talked above. That
      membership could also be billed annually. But how does it solve the
      ‘disappointment problem’? Here come the NFTs. In recent years,
      non-fungible tokens have proved to be the best solution for creating
      various membership clubs.


      As we know, buying and selling NFTs is extremely easy. One could create an
      app, which would automatically ask for a delivery address while
      transferring the NFT from one person to another. Also, when a user resells
      their NFT, the original creator (supplements provider) receives a cut from
      that sale. **This way we create a subscription model that benefits both
      the producer and the consumer.**
