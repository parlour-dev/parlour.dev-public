      # Blockchain can be used as an innovative way to solve ever-known business
      issues.


      Blockchain technology can help you solve various business issues. Getting
      financing for your business can be very difficult at times using
      traditional methods. Launching your own token or NFT collection can enable
      you to get the capital you need as well as share your venture with a
      community of blockchain enthusiasts from all over the world.


      Creating NFTs can create a long-lasting bond between you and your customer
      base. Providing your non-fungible tokens with utility will grant you
      customer loyalty and high return rate.


      By definition, blockchain is a global endeavour without borders. Use it to
      make your business global and reach new audience. The possibilities are
      endless!

      # Software **we built**
    software:
      - name: Kolor
        tagline: The blockchain social media
        description: >
          The project consisted of designing and coding a&#x20;

          social media platform integrated with the blockchain. Integration with
          the MetaMask wallet lets users put their posts on blockchain or mint
          them as NFTs. Because Kolor is a dapp, we had to ensure a certain
          level of **decentralization**. This was a whole new challenge, given
          that decentralized technologies integrated with blockchain are at a
          very early stage of development. Because of that, we had to resort to
          creating our own, **innovative methods**.

      - name: PukPuk
        tagline: A mobile app for ordering services
        description: >
          The project consisted of creating a mobile app, which lets users offer
          and use various services. PukPuk was created from scratch by us. The
          work began from creating a few mockups of the app, in order to choose
          the proper visual identification. We settled on a UI which was based
          on bright colors, with strong orange accents. That way, the entirety
          was consistent with the PukPuk logo. Simultaneously, work began on
          implementing the front-end and the back-end.

      # **FAQ**
    questions:
      - question: Do you only handle blockchain projects?
        answer: >
          Even though we don't have hard rules, we specialize in Web3 projects.
          Of course, if the project needs Web2 elements, such as a landing page,
          Discord server or a mobile app, we happily help our clients with those
          elements.
      - question: Can you help us with graphic design?
        answer: >
          Of course. When delivering projects we use both in-house graphic
          designers and outside graphic design studios with which we have
          established relationships.&#x20;
      - question: Do you do marketing?
        answer: >
          We don’t see ourselves as marketing experts, due to this fact we do
          not offer marketing as a service. However, we have established
          relationships with marketing agencies, which specialize in promoting
          Web3 projects. **We will gladly give you their contact info and
          consult on the marketing strategy.**
      - question: Do you work with startups?
        answer: >
          Yes. We very much enjoy working with startups. Being young people, we
          perfectly understand the needs and the mindset of startups.
